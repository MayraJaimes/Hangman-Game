# Hangman-Game

In this app I created a hangman game. This app features dynamically updated HTML powered by my JavaScript code. The game code is organized as an object. The whole game and its properties are saved in an object.

The theme for this hangman game is sports. Key events were used to listen for the letters that the player types. Only letters are accepted as valid inputs.

When the game starts a random word is selected and there are underscores displayed in place of the letters. As the user guesses the correct letters they are revealed and replace the underscores.

There is a section that shows the player how many guesses they have remaining. There is also a section showing the letters that were already guessed. If you try guessing the same letter a message will display stating that you already tried that letter. After the user wins or loses the game it automatically chooses another word and makes the user play it.
